# NeuroShAIper
NeuroShAIper is an open-source deep learning pipeline for shape analysis of neuroanatomical structures. It combines graph neural networks and explainability methods to uncover spatial biomarkers directly from 3D brain surface meshes.

# This package is expected to be released by the end of 2025! Stay tuned :)
